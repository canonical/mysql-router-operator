MySQL Router is part of InnoDB Cluster, and is lightweight middleware that provides transparent routing between your application and back-end MySQL Servers. It can be used for a wide variety of use cases, such as providing high availability and scalability by effectively routing database traffic to appropriate back-end MySQL Servers. The pluggable architecture also enables developers to extend MySQL Router for custom use cases.

This MySQL Router operator charm comes in two flavours to deploy and operate MySQL Router on [physical/virtual machines](https://github.com/canonical/mysql-router-operator) and [Kubernetes](https://github.com/canonical/mysql-router-k8s-operator). Both offer features identical set of features and simplifies deployment, scaling, configuration and management of MySQL Router in production at scale in a reliable way.
