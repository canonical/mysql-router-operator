# Major Rollback

> :information_source: **Example**: MySQL Router 9.0 -> MySQL Router 8.0

Currently, the charm supports MySQL Router 8.0 only; therefore, minor rollbacks are only possible. Canonical is NOT planning to support in-place rollbacks for the major MySQL Router version change as the old MySQL cluster installation with old MySQL Router will stay nearby and can be reused for the rollback.
