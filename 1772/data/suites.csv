"Upgrade to an invalid version and test rollback.

    Relies on the charm built in the previous test (test_upgrade_from_edge).
    Furthermore, the previous test will refresh the charm till revision 102.
    This test will refresh the charm till the revision in src/snap.py, thus avoiding
    no-ops.
